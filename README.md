# DS internship test

## note 
### ai usage
  i tried to limit it and had not used any ai help excelt when generating data for ner. but that's it. most of the code i got from official documentations or youtube tutorials;  
### my impressions
  this repo contains two tasks I wrote for an internship test. and honestly? I enjoyed it. most of the stuff required I had to learn as I engaged on the project. and what's strange is that I liked it, too. struggling I was, not to mention all the stress and pressure (I really wanna learn more and Im just burning from the inside with enthusiasm). 
  I failed to meet one of the requirements: in the second task u r supposed to implement a transformer model. but I haven't ever done any. and I'm talking NER and not just transformers. I hope it's not a big problem. The rest of them -- the requirements -- I sticked to as throughoutly as I could. not that it's up to me to judge.
